1. Correlation Finding
There are three different correlation finding algorithms, as described in https://bitbucket.org/fmetze/aladdin/wiki/Correlation-Finding.
To run a specific correlation finding algorithm:
$ python find_correlation_*.py 1>out 2>err
Error messages (file/keyframe not found exceptions, etc.) will be printed to standard error.

1.1. Naive Approach
    # get nid-cid (noiseme id - image concept id) pairs and their scores
    python scripts/find_correlation.py 1>out 2>err
    # sort by nid-cid pairs
    sort out > sorted
    # aggregate the pairs with same noiseme_id - image_concept_id
    python scripts/aggregate_correlation.py sorted > aggregated
    # sort the aggregated correlations by score
    sort -rk3 aggregated > final

1.2. Probabilistic Approach
    python scripts/find_correlation_prob.py 1>out 2>err

1.3. BLRT Approach
    python scripts/find_correlation_BLRT.py 1>out 2>err

2. Normalization
    python scripts/normalize.py out > normalized

3. Correlation Fusion
    python scripts/weighted_sum.py 1.out 2.out 3.out > weighted_sum

4. Correlation Refinement
    python scripts/refine.py weighted_sum > refined

5. Build New Training Set
    python scripts/build_train_set.py refined > training
